## Introduction

Studying the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy provides valuable informed decisions that could help to shape policices and help populations in these areas.

## Getting Started

### Questions

1. Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
2. Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
3. Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
4. What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
5. What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

## Usage

Using Jupyter Notebook to open .py files.

Using data provided by all_data.csv. The dataset provided has the following columns of data:
- Country - nation
- Year - the year for the observation
- Life expectancy at birth (years) - life expectancy value in years
- GDP - Gross Domestic Product in U.S. dollars

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the Issues page.
